# svg-logo-gen

This week, we were assigned to create an SVG Logo maker, which conceptually peaked my interest. Created an image generator using code was not something I saw myself doing nor did I think I was capable of. Regardless of my first impressions, I got to work. I had a hard time trying to impliment the insturcutions for the program to interact with the user's request in the beginning of the project but I was able to settle on creating an array that provided the user with options.

Telling the program how to generate the images based on the user's inputs also took a lot of time but thanks to lots of hours spent researching. I was able to create if & else if statements that got the job done. 

I am truly happy with the results and am grateful for the progress I have been able to make after completing this assignment.
